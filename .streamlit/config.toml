# Streamlit version: 1.9.0

[global]

# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available and, if not, prints a warning asking for you
# to install it. The watchdog module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's ability to detect
# changes to files in your filesystem.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: false
disableWatchdogWarning = false

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script via "python my_script.py".
# Default: true
showWarningOnDirectExecution = true


[logger]

# Level of logging: 'error', 'warning', 'info', or 'debug'.
# Default: 'info'
level = "info"

# String format for logging messages. If logger.datetimeFormat is set, logger messages will default to
#   `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(message)s
#`. See [Python's documentation](https://docs.python.org/2.6/library/logging.html#formatter-objects) for available
# attributes.
# Default: "%(asctime)s %(message)s"
messageFormat = "%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(module)s::%(funcName)s: %(message)s"


[client]

# Whether to enable st.cache.
# Default: true
caching = true

# Controls whether uncaught app exceptions are displayed in the browser. By default, this is set to True and Streamlit
# displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks in the browser.
# If set to False, an exception will result in a generic message being shown in the browser, and exceptions and
# tracebacks will be printed to the console only.
# Default: true
showErrorDetails = true


[runner]

# Allows you to type a variable or string by itself in a single line of Python code to write it to the app.
# Default: true
magicEnabled = false

# Install a Python tracer to allow you to stop or pause your script at any point and introspect it. As a side-effect,
# this slows down your script's execution.
# Default: false
installTracer = false

# Sets the MPLBACKEND environment variable to Agg inside Streamlit to prevent Python crashing.
# Default: true
fixMatplotlib = true

# Run the Python Garbage Collector after each script execution. This can help avoid excess memory use in Streamlit apps,
# but could introduce delay in rerunning the app script for high-memory-use applications.
# Default: true
postScriptGC = true

# Handle script rerun requests immediately, rather than waiting for script execution to reach a yield point.
# Enabling this will make Streamlit much more responsive to user interaction, but it can lead to race conditions in
# apps that mutate session_state data outside of explicit session_state assignment statements.
# Default: false
fastReruns = false


[server]

# List of folders that should not be watched for changes. This impacts both "Run on Save" and @st.cache.
# Relative paths will be taken as relative to the current working directory.
# Example: ['/home/user1/env', 'relative/path/to/folder']
# Default: []
folderWatchBlacklist = []

# Change the type of file watcher used by Streamlit, or turn it off completely.
# Allowed values:
#   * "auto" : Streamlit will attempt to use the watchdog module, and falls back to polling if watchdog is not
#              available.
#   * "watchdog" : Force Streamlit to use the watchdog module.
#   * "poll" : Force Streamlit to always use polling.
#   * "none" : Streamlit will not watch files.
# Default: "auto"
fileWatcherType = "auto"

# If false, will attempt to open a browser window on start.
# Default: false unless
#   (1) we are on a Linux box where DISPLAY is unset, or
#   (2) we are running in the Streamlit Atom plugin.
headless = false

# Automatically rerun script when the file is modified on disk.
# Default: false
runOnSave = false

# The address where the server will listen for client and browser connections. Use this if you want to bind the server
# to a specific address. If set, the server will only be accessible from this address, and not from any aliases
# (like localhost).
# Default: (unset)
# address =

# Default: 8501

# Default: false
enableWebsocketCompression = false


[browser]

# Internet address where users should point their browsers in order to connect to the app. Can be IP address or DNS name
# and path.
# This is used to:
#   - Set the correct URL for CORS and XSRF protection purposes.

#   - Open the browser
# Default: 'localhost'

# Whether to send usage statistics to Streamlit.
# Default: true
