## About

This is the _Wrath & Glory Space Hulk Generator_. It creates random maps for [Cubicle7](https://cubicle7games.com)'s
Warhammer 40k role-playing game _[Wrath & Glory](https://cubicle7games.com/our-games/wrath-glory)_.

It uses the random tables from [_Redacted Records_](https://cubicle7games.com/product/redacted-records) and then renders
the rolled events into a vectorized map using [graphviz](https://graphviz.org).

Since this is an early stage project, I really appreciate feedback! So if you have any improvement suggestions or
feature requests or if you found bugs, simply head over to the 
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/LordFckHelmchen/wrath-and-glory-space-hulk-generator) and open an
[issue](https://github.com/LordFckHelmchen/wrath-and-glory-space-hulk-generator/issues).
